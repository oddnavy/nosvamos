Whilst in Phnom Penh we visited two remnants of Pol Pot's brief but bloody rule of Cambodia.

**Tuol Sleng Museum**

When the Khmer Rouge came to power 1975 Tuol Svay High School was converted into prison S 21. It was the largest center of its kind housing 17000 people between 1975-1978 and was used to detain and and interrogate anyone seen a threat to the government. Once prisoners were confessed to their 'crimes' and gave the names of family and friends they were taken to the extermination camp at Choeung Ek.

The torture used at the prison was horrific to hear about and we found the walls and walls of prisoner photos who died at the hands of the Khmer Rouge a somber experience.

**Choeung Ek: The Killing Fields**

The main Khmer Rogue extermination camp for Phnom Penh contains 129 communal graves, only 86 have been exhumed but it is believed up to 20000 people are buried here in graves containing up to 450 people. Seeing teeth and bones still visible on the ground nearly 40 later was very sad.
