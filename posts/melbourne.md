So we have been in Melbourne for a whole month already.

We had a unsettled start, due to lack of organisation on the accommodation front.

I experienced a 'Roo burger' on the first weekend. We have had some beautiful weather and walks around the city.

We now have a fantastic place to live with some lovely Â people and one of us has a job!
