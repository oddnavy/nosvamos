Sihanoukville was our final destination in Cambodia, a beach resort with bars/restaurants lining the seafront, it was a relaxing place to end our time here. Dave hit the hotel casino and lost a few dollars (\$15 to be precise) but now understands the rules to Blackjack and claims he can win it all back.

We also went on an awesome boat trip where we stopped off at some islands for some snorkelling (Carman's first time), lunch on the picturesque [Bamboo Island](http://www.cambodia-beach.com/coasters/bamboo-island.html) and some time on a remote beach.
