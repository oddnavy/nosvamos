The capital of Malaysia does not have a very good reputation. We were advised by some to avoid spending any time there if we could. However I've wanted to go to Kuala Lumpur from a very young age and love cities so we decided to see for ourselves.

We only spent two days in KL but they were a very good two days. We were recommended to go to the Traders Hotel skybar in the evening to see the Petronas Twin Towers lit up amongst the high rise city. The bar was very fancy with a swimming pool with laterns floating in it in the middle. We arrived at dusk by chance so we were able to see the city in daylight and then all the dazzling lights in the darkness. When we arrived all of the window seats were reserved so we asked if we could sit there until guests arrived but this was not an option. We asked to be put on the waiting list so we could sit there once people left and we didn't have to wait too long. This was great and the view was fantastic, we ended up staying longer than planned and splashing out on cocktails and tapas.

The following morning we had a productive morning of museums. The Kuala Lumpur city gallery was more of a glorified gift shop although nice to see the people making the models. The Islamic Arts Museum however was much more interesting and massive.

Dave had discovered that afternoon tea at the Atmosphere 360 restuarant was only Â£2 more than going up to the viewing point so we met up with Millie and Anna our diving pals from Ko Tao and really made the most of the buffet. We stayed for the full 2 hours, grazing over snadwiches and yummy cakes in the relvoving restaurant.
