En route down to Malaysia we made a last minute decision on the recommendation of the Norwegians to go via this beautiful little island located amongstÂ Adang Archipelago national park. As we cruised in on the morning speedboat both of our jaws dropped. The island was how we had imagined all of the Thai islands to look, beautiful turquoise sea and bright white sand. Up until this point we were starting to believe that perhaps this didn't exist anymore but how wrong we were. As you can see it's pretty much as close to a tropical paradise as you can get.

While we were here we spent the majority of the time relaxing in the shade on the beach and floating around the sea whilst watching the little fish dashing around us. It's a tiny island and you probably walk around most of it half a day, we did a fair bit of exploring and decided that Sunrise beach was by far our favourite.

We would have loved to do some more diving here but we are now beginning to watch our spending as the Australian leg of our tour rapidly approaches.
