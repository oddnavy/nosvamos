And so comes the end of our first month on the road. It has been an extremely varied and exciting experience. We have met some great people, been to some awesome places and eaten some of India's best loved foods.

**Dave's Highlights**

1\. Canoeing through the tiny backwater canals near Alleppey. We were so close to doing a houseboat tour and so glad we didn't, it gave us a much better perspective of how the local people live on the river and we got to see areas untainted by tourism.

2\.  The best South Indian meal we had in Ernakulam at [Gokul Oottupura](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297633-d2019309-Reviews-Gokul_oottupura-Kochi_Cochin_Kerala.html), great food, great atmosphere and a hot price to top it off.

3\. A night at the palace. Its not often you can say you stayed a royal palace, but we had the pleasure of doing so in Orchha.

**Carman's Highlights**

1\. Sailing down the Ganges. We spent two days on the boat and camped on the sandy riverbank with great friends and tasty grub.

2\. Sunset walk in the cute town of Orchha.  Drinking Chai on the rocks watching the majestic views beyond the river.

3\. Uncontrollable yoga giggles.
