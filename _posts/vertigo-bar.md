When we heard about some friends visiting a skybar, a rooftop bar at the top of a skyscraper, we immediately decided that would like to do the same. Having heard that this bar in particular was used in the filming of Hangover 2, we decided that this was clearly the place to go.

We spent the day on a mission to acquire some smart trousers for Adam in light of the dress code. We then got all dressed up ready to go and enjoy the incredible city views from the roof top bar, only to be told that going on a Saturday night was a silly idea as the queue would be ridiculous and you have to book in advance, _oh dear._

Luckily we were recommended to go to the [Vertigo Bar](http://www.banyantree.com/en/bangkok/experience_the_resort/dining/vertigo_and_moon_bar) as an alternative and it was absolutley fanastic. It was nice and fancy which was a nice opportunity to enjoy getting a bit dressed up. They don't allow flip flops but provided black flats for the ladies. Men had to wear shorts and shoes but the boys were allowed in in their nice trainer shoes. The views were amazing and the atmosphere was lovely, so we t0ok lots of photos. Us girls treated ourselves to a cocktail as we were up on the 63rd floor of a very plush hotel. It was definitely a highlight of Bangkok.
