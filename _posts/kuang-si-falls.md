After an exciting elephant orientated morning we headed on to a beautiful waterfall about an hour from Louang Prabang. As you can see it was just lush. We climbed up a muddy track and some damp steps right up to the top of the waterfall and you could literally walk across, it was incredible. Further down the falls there was another tree rope swing this one was somewhat more difficult to get the hang of due to extra height and slippy rope and I did embarrassingly make a bit of a pigs ear out of it, but it was entertaining.
