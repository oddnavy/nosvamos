After a very pleasant flight with Indigo (we highly recommend this airline) on a brand new plane, we arrived in Cochin. We then cruised over to Fort Cochin in an awesome [white Ambassador](http://www.flickr.com/photos/conchwillow/3353723038/lightbox/) by our driver Anthony. There was a distinct lack of cows on the surprisingly well-surfaced road which took some adjusting to.

During our stay in this markedly different part of India with strong Christian influences and filled with European style charming Caf_é_s we pottered around the small town and took in the sights including the traditional Chinese fishing nets and a local game of cricket.

In the evening we attended a Kathakali show. A traditional Keralan performance which dates back to the 17th century where all communication is non-verbal with sign language style hand gestures, facial expression and rhythmic music. The performers wore colourful costumes and vibrant makeup made from natural products.

The narrative was quite hard to follow but the show was still undoubtedly entertaining.
