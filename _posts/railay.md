_Beaches only accessible by boat._

From Ao Nang we ventured out on kayaks around the dramatic limestone cliffs along the coastline, exploring small caves Â and the four beaches of Railay. Here we had yummy noodle lunch from one of the restaurant boats.

The area is famous for its rock climbing and had we stayed longer we may have been tempted but we were keen to move onwards in the direction of Malaysia.
