We had a relaxing few days in this quiet and peaceful island north of Sumatra. We paid less than a fiver to stay in a bungalow on stilts over the rocky coast looking over crystal clear water. We did some snorkelling and explored a little bit to find this lovely beach with an amazing Italian restaurant with an amazing Indonesia owner who learnt to cook from her Italian mother-in-law, her spaghetti was fantastic. Having walked for around an hour over some serious hills to get there we found out we could have just swam from our bungalow, whoops!
