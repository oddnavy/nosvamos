_A belated Merry Christmas to everyone!_

Christmas day this year was an unusual one with a lengthy bus journey from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh.Â We added some excitement with cricket and cockroach lunch snacks. A little bus/lorry drama kept us on our toes towards the end of the journey! Dinner was a local Cambodian dish called Lok Lak followed by cocktails on a rooftop bar.
