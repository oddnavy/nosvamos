Delhi. Having heard poor reviews of Delhi we made the decision to not hang about in the city for too long....However we regretted this somewhat and really enjoyed our short spell there. It was dare I say it slightly homely getting on and off the metro (aside from a bit of friendly groping, before discovering the ladies only carriage) and mooching around.

Old Delhi was incredible, endless back streets containing 'districts of shop', the saree, technical, childrens, clothes shops were all congregated together in their own zone. It was almost like the worlds largest department store, with everything you could possible want or need at a ridiculously low cost.
