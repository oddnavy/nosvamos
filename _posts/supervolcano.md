In light of the bad weather weÂ made a last minute decision to skip the volcano walk in Berastagi and head onwards to Lake Toba, a massive volcanic lake with an island popped in the middle of it. The journey here was pretty long but the scenery was well worth it, despite a fair bit of rain. Our few days here were spent relaxing, reading, job hunting and monsoon watching. On the one sunny day we rented bicycles and did a monstrous cycle ride around the island seeing some of the smaller villages and taking breaks for food and drinks on the lake side. By the end of the day we could barely sit on the bikes due to pain.
