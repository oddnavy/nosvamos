Following our amazing few days on the diving course (post to come as we are awaiting a few snaps) we had two more nights accommodation on Ko Tao. After 5 days already on the island everything was getting quite familiar so we decided to strike out and explore some more of the island. On the first day a group of us went to Shark Bay, a supposedly great place to snorkel and see several types of reef shark. Sadly the visibility was poor, to the extent that we couldn't see our hands held out in front of us. In contrast to when we were diving where we could see at least 10-15 metres. So in the end the end we gave up on that and just relaxed on the quiet tree-lined beach.

For our final day we decided to venture over to the nearby island of [Nangyuan](http://www.nangyuan.com/en/home.html). The views and beaches here were phenomenal and the waters were the clearest we have seen. A perfect end to our time here.
