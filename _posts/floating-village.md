Following our visit to Ankgor Wat we took a boat trip to a floating village. It was impressive to see the people living on the water with boat shops doing the rounds. We saw a lot of poverty here with children begging and using snakes as entertainment for tourists. The sad fact about this is that if the children make the money from the tourists they don't see the need to go to school.
