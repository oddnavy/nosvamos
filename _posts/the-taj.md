Our brief stay in Agra began by joining the cattle market of tourists trying to get the perfect snap of the famous symmetrical mausoleum. It definitely lived up to the expectations and was truly beautiful.

We took a tour of the impressive Red Fort, during which Dave decided to get into a ruckus with a red faced monkey (yes, that's the aggressive ones). So he decides to kick said monkey after it tried to steal his bottle of water. Meanwhile I'm having a mild panic attack and could not absorb the rest of the tour.
