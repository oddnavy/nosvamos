In Melaka, the Dutch square and surrounding areas harbour many, many museums, separated into buildings which each focus on a chosen subject. The choice is endless if you fancy a museumy day. Instead, we headed to the old trains and aeroplanes to play.

The old town is very quaint, fairly touristy but more of an Asian destination.

It is very easy to while away the hours just having a wander and enjoying watching this UNESCO World Heritage city, for free!

We stayed at [Old Town Guesthouse](http://www.melakaguesthouse.com/) near little India, which was very pleasant and had the most helpful manager.

Here they have eco tuk tuks made from bikes with side seats and blaring boom boxes on the back (usually playing Gangnam style, might I add) and decorated with the likes of Hello Kitty and many bright flowers.
