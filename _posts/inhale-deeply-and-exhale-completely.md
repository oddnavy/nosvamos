Our final few days in India were spent relaxing and unwinding in Varkala, Kerala. Every morning we did our yoga class on the roof top which was an entertaining struggle. We found an amazing breakfast place with freshly squeezed juices of every variety, served with a delicious fresh fruit salad with curd, muesli and honey.

Afternoons were spent reading in the sun  and enjoying the refreshing sea. The fantastic tiger prawns were a highlight (thank you Dave and Randa) and drinking beer from tea mugs as most places on the front don't have a license.
