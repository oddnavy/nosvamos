Whilst in Ho Chi Min City we visited the Cu Chi Tunnels, a 250km tunnel network used by the Viet Con during the Vietnam war. This tunnel system is vast and included tunnels with living space, kitchens and even hospitals! We saw some model traps that they used to hinder the American troops and these were pretty brutal.

Later, Dave had a great time shooting an AK-47s and M16s in a firing range near the tunnels.
