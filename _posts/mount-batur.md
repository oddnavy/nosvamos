Don't ask us why, but for some reason we thought it would be a good idea to get up at 1:30am and climb a volcano in the pouring rain and strong winds. As a result we saw some beautiful clouds/fog and not a lot else. The walk was quite fast paced and the volcanic ground uneven and unstable, but it was a great experience, as we descended and the clouds cleared we were able to imagine what we would have seen on a clear day. Unfortunately we were unable to see the big crater at the top either but we did see some steam escaping from a vent and get a great snap of Carman's glasses all fogged up!
