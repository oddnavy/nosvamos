_Carmans favourite city_

This is the capital of Vietnam and it was just how we imagined it. We loved the busy bustling markets full of locals with fantastic street foods, sweet and savoury. Live fish and sharks. We enjoyed [weasel shit coffee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopi_Luwak) to warm up in the surprising cool climate and buying real North Face jackets which failed quality control tests for £20. We also went to the Ho Chi Min mausoleum which was an unusual experience but we learnt a lot about his life.

For our last meal with most of the group we were lucky enough to be invited to our tour guide's (Zoom Zoom's) home within Hanoi itself for a home-cooked meal provided by his wife. This involved a delicious Vietnamese style indoor BBQ and homebrewed rice wine.
