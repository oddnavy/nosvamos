Following Penang we briefly headed down to Pangkor Island to break up our journey to the south of Malaysia. It was quite a slow day waiting for ferrys and buses but we eventually got the the island early evening. We had booked somewhere to stay but it looked pretty awful so we looked around for something better and ideally cheaper, but were unsuccessful.

There are lots of hornbills on the island so we were able to see their feeding time. We then walked down to have a fish dinner and it absolutely poured with rain. It was the same the following morning. We went for a brief walk then decided to get back on the road down towards Melaka, for a romantic Valentines day on the bus.
