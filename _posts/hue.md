Here we only stayed for one evening so we took advantage of a motorbike tour to see the sights of the city and surrounding countryside. The tour cruised down the narrow roads between the paddy fields,Â passing boats built with assorted metal left by USA at the end of the Vietnam war. We visited a few old temples, some scared by battle and heard stories told by our guide who lived through the war.
