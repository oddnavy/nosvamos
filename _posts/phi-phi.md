We knew what to expect when we went to Phi Phi, party party, but we really went for the beauty of the island. Though it is lovely we weren't quite sold, until we decided to do some diving there. The diving was _fantastic_. We went with a company called [The Adventure Club](http://www.phi-phi-adventures.com/) who were really good. Bella who was working in the shop the day we went in for a chat about snorkelling in Phi Phi won us over into diving in Phi Phi by explaining how good is there. I was very nervous as it was our first fun dive, but Jade our dive master helped took me under her wing (or fin) and helped me improve my diving by being much more efficient with my air. We had lunch on the boat in Maya bay (where the Beach is filmed). Dave had an awesome curry. The second dive we saw 3 turtles with was _incredible_. We think the best thing about Phi Phi is the diving.
