_This is a bit belated due to a serious lack of Internet in Nepal/we've been very busy on the tour- lots of activities and new experiences every day._

Kathmandu was our first destination and was eye-opening to say the least. We were greeted by extreme poverty, rubbish everywhere and a completely different quality of life which, although we anticipated, was still quite shocking.

It was also where our tour to Delhi began, we met the rest of our group (great people) and visited a few temples/holy sites over the first few days before setting off through the mountains to Chitwan National Park.
