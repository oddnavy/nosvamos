We arrived in the late afternoon, just in time to catch the sun setting behind the mountains, casting a beautiful orange glow over the river. We went kayaking down the river past the old tubing bars (all which are now pretty much closed since the drinking + tubing ban). We also went to the awesome mountain caves and blue lagoon where we made plenty of use the tree rope swing (As always I took some persuasion).
