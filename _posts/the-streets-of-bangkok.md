After 30 days on the road and 4 very different countries we arrived back in Bangkok and had to say farewell to the final few fantastic people. It was really sad to say goodbye to the group after a month together but we celebrated well and Carman embarrassed herself by banging out some karaoke classics.

When we got back to Bangkok we were lucky enough to cross paths with Adam and Mel, which was excellent. We actually made it to Ko San Road this time and had some buckets at a small bar on the side of the road but we certainly will not be rushing back.

Over the next few days Carman got quite sick and had a small toilet-ing issue which meant she needed to have a day off in bed. Meanwhile I went to the prison museum , had an incredible falafel lunch and caught the boat back along the river.

Once she was feeling better we decided to get ourselves a haircut before we headed out back onto the road, which was the longest haircut in the world, and slightly stressful as the guy translating decided that I asked for an undercut!

We found a fantastic little hostel called the [Cosy Bangkok Place Hostel](http://www.cozybangkok.com/) which we would recommend to anyone going to Bangkok and not wanting to stay near Ko San Road.
