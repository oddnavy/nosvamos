Having heard many good things about secret cinema events in London, David and I were quite excited to hear that a similar event was heading to Melbourne. We purchased tickets to this interactive cinema experience after being given a heads up from some friends of friends. We bought tickets to a cinema screening without the film name, only the instructions to dress in white, bring a torch, pen and camera.

The venue was revealed around 24 hours before the event, a secondary school in Collingwood. Our very organised friends managed to get hold of some boiler suits so that was our outfits sorted. We cycled there of course, and felt a mixture of nerves and excitement as we were very unsure of what to expect.

We queued for quite sometime with some of the events team in character as swedish investigators to manage us. We had to go through an assessment process to establish if we were of a scientific or pychological mindset. This determined which lectures we attended. We both ended up in the Pyschology lecture, run by a fanastic female actress who spoke about interogation in relation to the murder in the film, she focused on members of the audience and demonstrate some interrogation techniques bringing comedy into the picture. We then were picked at random to go on a field trip on the grounds of the school to go to the crime scene and speak to some witnessess to try and establish what events had occurred leading up to the crime.

Following this we marched into the school sang the swedish national anthem and watched 'Let The Right One In', which was _very_ good.
