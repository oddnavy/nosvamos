After our few days in Hanoi we had the pleasure of flying toLaos on the national airline Lao Airlines, we tried our first Beerlao with our yummy inflight burger meal. Going hustle and bustle of one capital city to the quiet and peaceful capital of another was amazing, so close yet so different! The next morning we explored the city by bicycle, visited the Arc de Triomphe-esque monument and a hugeÂ modern temple complex.
