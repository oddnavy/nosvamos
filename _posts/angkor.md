As we stood in the predawn darkness wondering why several hundred people had dragged themselves of out of bed at 4am, the sun began to slowly rise behind the great temple. We took our first glimpse of Angkor Wat silhouetted in front of pale blue sky and projecting an almost perfect mirror image of itself on the still lake beneath it.

After nipping back to the hotel for breakfast we returned to explore the vast temple complex for the rest of the day. As well as revisiting Angkor Wat we visited several other temples including Ta Prohm, made famous by its use in theÂ Tomb Raider film. This temple was great because it has been partially reclaimed by the jungle, with huge trees growing from the ruin.
