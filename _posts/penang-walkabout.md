Following the New Year festivities we spent the day exploring Penang by foot. We followed a walking tour led between 'welded iron wall caricatures' laid out around historic areas of the city which each sculpture including a historical or interesting fact about the area of the city. On our way around the city we sampled some street food and some delicious chicken Samosas for 20p.

The city itself was extremely quiet as most shops close around the new year, so it was fairly surreal experience with the streets being almost deserted in some areas making it hard to imagine what the city is like the rest of the year. Even the backpacker hub of Love Lane was peaceful - very different to Khao San Road in Thailand.
