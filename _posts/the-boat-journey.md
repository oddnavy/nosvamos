We decided to get an overnight boat back to the mainland and go over to Koh Phi Phi. The overnight boat was not quite as we had expected and resembled a slave ship with 150 people squeezed in like sardines on thin matresses along the floor for this rocky journey. Never been so greatful for travel sickness tablets and my facemask.
