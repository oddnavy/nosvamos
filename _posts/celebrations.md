Naturally we went out to celebrate passing our diving exam with our group, instructor and the other group we had got to know on the boat. We had a nice meal then went for some buckets, Carman got a bit carried away thought she would be able to skip on the flaming rope but I reined her in and luckily we made it back to the bungalow before she was very sick.
